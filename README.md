# Bug Report Classification: Performance-Related or Not

## Overview
This repository contains datasets and code used to compare the performance of a baseline and a proposed solution for classifying bug reports as performance-related or not.

## Contents
- **Datasets**: Data used for training and evaluation.
- **Code**:
  - `baseline.py`: the source code of the baseline.
  - `svm.py`: the source code of the proposed approach.
  - `train_model.py`: the code for training the model of the proposed approach.
  - `bug_report_classifier.py`: the bug report classification tool.
  - `statistical_test.py`: a script to run statistical analysis on the experiments' results.
- **Raw Results**: Data output used in experimental analysis.
- **Documentation**:
  - `requirements.pdf`: Lists the requirements for using the tool.
  - `manual.pdf`: Provides guidance on using the classification tool.
  - `replication.pdf`: Details the steps to replicate the results presented in the report.

## How to Use
1. Review the `requirements.pdf` file for software and dependencies.
2. Refer to `manual.pdf` for instructions on using the classification tool.
3. To reproduce experimental results, follow the steps outlined in `replication.pdf`.
